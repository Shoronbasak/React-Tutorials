// we have to name this file as chai.jsx as the chai.js won't work here it only works on the create-react-app , and there we can name the files and import it as js only 
// but here we have to do it as JSX
// and have to name the file with an upper case as Chai , or else it won't work and give errors


// if there is no html tags inside the return part then , we can name it as Chai.js , but when the html components are inside the return part then we have to compulsorily name it as jsx file only(some library might not force but some might)
